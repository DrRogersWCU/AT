Focusing on the sub-text of Arendt’s writings which questions “how to think” adequately in political theory whilst categorically refraining from explicitly investigating meta-theoretical questions of epistemology and methodology, the book characterizes her theorizing as an oscillating movement between the experiential positions of philosophy and politics, and by its distinctly multi-contextual perspective. In contrast to the “not of this world” attitude of philosophy, the book argues that Arendt’s political theory is “of this world”. In contrast to politics, it refrains from being “at home” in any particular part of this world and instead wanders between the multiple horizons of the many different political worlds in time and space. The book explores how these two decisive motives of Arendt’s theoretical self-perception majorly influence her epistemological, methodological and normative frame of reference and inspire her understanding of major concepts, including politics, judgment, understanding, nature, and space.

Constructing an Arendtian theory of aesthetics from the philosopher's fragmentary writings on art and perception, Sjöholm begins a vibrant new chapter in Arendt scholarship that expands her relevance for contemporary philosophers. Arendt wrote thoughtfully about the role of sensibility and aesthetic judgment in political life and on the power of art to enrich human experience. Sjöholm draws a clear line from Arendt's consideration of these subjects to her reflections on aesthetic encounters and works of art mentioned in her published writings and stored among her memorabilia. This delicate effort allows Sjöholm to revisit Arendt's political concepts of freedom, plurality, and judgment from an aesthetic point of view and incorporate Arendt's insight into current discussions of literature, music, theater, and visual art. Though Arendt did not explicitly outline an aesthetics, Sjöholm's work substantively incorporates her perspective into contemporary reckonings with radical politics and their relationship to art.","2015","2026-02-02 18:47:40","2026-02-02 18:51:18","","","","","","","","","Columbia Themes in Philosophy, Social Criticism, and the Arts","","","","Columbia University Press","New York, [New York","eng","","","","","","","Publication Title: How to see things : doing aesthetics with Arendt","","","","Arendt Hannah 1906-1975; Aesthetics; Art – Philosophy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the next twenty-five years, she wrote ten more books and developed a set of ideas that profoundly influenced the way America and Europe addressed the central questions and dilemmas of World War II. In this concise book, Elisabeth Young-Bruehl introduces her mentor's work to twenty-first-century readers. Arendt's ideas, as much today as in her own lifetime, illuminate those issues that perplex us, such as totalitarianism, terrorism, globalization, war, and ""radical evil. ""Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, who was Arendt's doctoral student in the early 1970's and who wrote the definitive biography of her mentor in 1982, now revisits Arendt's major works and seminal ideas. Young-Bruehl considers what Arendt's analysis of the totalitarianism of Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union can teach us about our own times, and how her revolutionary understanding of political action is connected to forgiveness and making promises for the future. The author also discusses The Life of the Mind, Arendt's unfinished meditation on how to think about thinking. Placed in the context of today's political landscape, Arendt's ideas take on a new immediacy and importance. They require our attention, Young-Bruehl shows, and continue to bring fresh truths to light.","2006","2026-02-02 18:47:40","2026-02-02 18:53:08","","","","","","","","","Why X matters","","","","Yale University Press","New Haven","eng","","","","","","","Publication Title: Why Arendt matters LCCN: 2006018235","","","","Arendt Hannah 1906-1975 – Political and social views; Political science – Philosophy; Totalitarianism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st ed.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Is it a type of evidence or a mode of reasoning? In a world characterized by material and political inequalities, whose common sense should inform the law? Common Sense and Legal Judgment explores this rhetorically powerful phrase, arguing that common sense, when invoked in political and legal discourses without adequate reflection, poses a threat to the quality and legitimacy of legal judgment. Often operating in the service of conservatism, populism, or majoritarianism, common sense can harbour stereotypes, reproduce unjust power relations, and silence marginalized people. Nevertheless, drawing the works of theorists such as Thomas Reid, Antonio Gramsci, and Hannah Arendt into conversation with rulings by the Supreme Court of Canada, Patricia Cochran demonstrates that with careful attention, the democratic, egalitarian, and community-sustaining aspects of common sense can be brought to light. A call for critical self-reflection and the close scrutiny of power relationships and social contexts, this book is a direct response to social justice predicaments and their confounding relationships to law. Creative and interdisciplinary, Common Sense and Legal Judgment reinvigorates feminist and anti-poverty understandings of judgment, knowledge, justice, and accountability.","2017","2026-02-02 18:47:40","2026-02-02 18:50:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","McGill-Queen's University Press","Montreal, [Quebec Province","eng","","","","","","","Publication Title: Common sense and legal judgment : community knowledge, political power, and rhetorical practice","","","","Common sense; Judgment; Justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st ed.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"CTYL3FPH","book","2019","Reinhardt, , Mark","The Art of Being Free : Taking Liberties with Tocquevile, Marx, and Arendt","","978-1-5017-4306-1","","","","The ""art of being free"" is an essential part of democracy. It involves, Mark Reinhardt believes, bringing into being the multiple spaces in and practices through which individuals and groups help to constitute their lives, their selves, their worlds. Americans are presently witnessing a contraction of officially sanctioned spaces for citizen action. It is now crucial, Reinhardt argues, to identify ways of opening new spaces for the direct practice of democratic politics.Reinhardt treats the writings of Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, and Hannah Arendt as exemplary sources for an expansion of political possibility. These writers indicate where and how the new spaces can be brought into being, and they reveal acts of making space as some of the prime moments of politics. Reinhardt's extended readings of these writers, never previously treated together, are quite unlike the familiar understandings of their thought. ""Taking liberties,"" he brings the literary and political sensibility usually associated with postmodernism to a sympathetic if critical encounter with eminently modern thinkers. The result is a strong and idiosyncratic book, accessible and stylish, that mixes acute readings of canonical thinkers with more practical applications and illustrations. Reinhardt combines attention to textual detail and nuance with concern for contemporary politics, discussing as an unusually inventive example the AIDS activist group ACT UP.","2019","2026-02-02 18:47:40","2026-02-02 18:51:36","","","","","","","","","Contestations","","","","Cornell University Press,","Ithaca, NY","eng","","","","","","","Publication Title: The Art of Being Free : Taking Liberties with Tocquevile, Marx, and Arendt","","","","Arendt Hannah 1906-1975; Marx Karl 1818-1883; PHILOSOPHY / Free Will & Determinism; Tocqueville Alexis de 1805-1859","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st ed.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That's the question film critic and food writer Alissa Wilkinson answered as she gathered a hypothetical table of women who challenged norms and defied conventional wisdom. Ella Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Hannah Arendt, Octavia Butler, Agnes Varda, Elizabeth David, Edna Lewis, Maya Angelou, Laurie Colwin: these smart, engaging, revolutionary, and creative twentieth-century women were all profoundly influenced by their own relationships to food, drink, and other elements of sustenance. In Salty, Wilkinson explores the ways food managed to root these women into their various callings. For some, it was cultivating perseverance in the face of hardship. For others, it was nurturing a freedom to act, even in the face of opposition, toward justice and equality. For others, it was an examination of what it means to be human with all its desire, heartbreak, sacrifice, isolation, and liberty. Salty is Alissa Wilkinson's invitation to you. Join these sharp, empowered, and often subversive women and discover how to live with courage, agency, grace, smarts, snark, saltiness, and sometimes feasting–even in uncertain times. Ultimately you will leave this table with a greater understanding of food, drink, gathering, thinking, loving, and navigating the world.""– Provided by publisher","2022","2026-02-02 18:47:42","2026-02-02 18:51:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","Broadleaf Books, an imprint of 1517 Media","Minneapolis, MN","eng","","","","","","","Publication Title: Salty : lessons on eating, drinking, and living from revolutionary women","","","","Dinners and dining – History; Food – Social aspects; Food habits; Food writing; Women – Conduct of life; Women$$QWomen – Biography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Boundaries define some as members, others as aliens. But when state sovereignty is becoming frayed, and national citizenship is unravelling, definitions of political membership become much less clear. Indeed few issues in world politics today are more important, or more troubling. In her Seeley Lectures, the distinguished political theorist Seyla Benhabib makes a powerful plea, echoing Immanuel Kant, for moral universalism and cosmopolitan federalism. She advocates not open but porous boundaries, recognising both the admittance rights of refugees and asylum seekers, but also the regulatory rights of democracies. The Rights of Others is a major intervention in contemporary political theory, of interest to large numbers of students and specialists in politics, law, philosophy and international relations.","2004","2026-02-02 18:47:42","2026-02-02 18:52:53","","","","","","","","","The Seeley lectures ; 5","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","eng","","","","","","","Publication Title: The rights of others : aliens, residents and citizens","","","","Citizenship; Emigration and immigration; Immigrants – Civil rights; Internationalism; Noncitizens – Civil rights; Political rights; Refugees – Civil rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Steering clear of approaches to training that claim to free a performer's body or voice, Saner instead offers a close reading of political philosopher Hannah Arendt's theatrical understanding of freedom and political action (particularly 'Action' in The Human Condition and ""What is Freedom?"" in Between Past and Future) to extract the skills and qualities required of an actor to publicly perform an action that is 'wholly unexpected and unforeseen' (Arendt 1960: 43), make a new beginning, reveal who they are as well as the cracks in systems that appear unchangeable and bring about the experience of freedom, not only for themselves, but also, and more importantly, for the witnesses. How does one train to perform the event of freedom in the Arendtian sense? Following the image of Greta Thunberg on her first school strike, the article investigates how a personal action can resonate historically and incite collective activism. Given the unique relationship between a single performer and multiple spectators, the solo genre resonates with Arendt's description of freedom; however, it also raises specific challenges-particularly with respect to the neoliberalist celebration of a different kind of individual freedom and its influence on solo performance as a paradigm. Touching briefly upon solo documentary performance and solo autobiographical performance, the article arrives at clowning, as a solo form of training, acting and relating. Analysing Avner Eisenberg's clown pedagogy as well as Alison Hodge's core training, viewed here as clown training insofar as the ensemble becomes a space for solo emergence, the article formulates a training utopia that exercises-that is, rehearses, practises, educates, keeps working-an Arendtian freedom in action and thereby extends an invitation for all to be a Greta Thunberg.","2020","2026-02-02 18:47:42","2026-02-02 18:47:42","","146-154","","8","25","","","","","","","","Routledge","","eng","2021 The Author(s).

What does it mean to teach ‘common values’ to the coming generation? How do teachers find legitimacy and authority for this endeavour, not as family members or as politicians, but as teachers? To respond to this uncertainty, the paper takes the public/private distinction as a starting‐point for rethinking the place of the school. Drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt and of Jan Masschelein and Maarten Simons, it argues that the school is an in‐between place—a place that transforms values into ‘common goods’ and turns fostering into a teaching matter. The overall purpose of the paper is to sketch out the consequences of this ‘in‐betweenness’ for what it means to find one's voice as a teacher in fostering the coming generation.","2017","2026-02-02 18:47:42","2026-02-02 18:47:42","","461-475","","2","51","","","","","","","","Wiley","HOBOKEN","eng","2017 The Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.","","","","","","","","","","Teaching; Cultural Pluralism; Education & Educational Research; Educational philosophy; Educational Practices; Foreign Countries; Habermas Jurgen; History Of Social Sciences; Legitimacy; Legitimation; Multiculturalism & pluralism; Pedagogy; Private schools; Relatives; Role of Education; School Role; Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Teacher Empowerment; Teacher Role; Teachers; Uncertainty; Values; Values Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thoughts on Pedagogical Practice and Theory","Journal of philosophy of education","","0309-8249","","","In this paper, the notion of pearl diving as a metaphor for historical methodology is explored as a possible conceptual contribution to pedagogical thinking and practice. Pearl diving in the thinking of Hannah Arendt and Walter Benjamin refers to a process of bringing to life and coming to terms with a fragmented past, and requires of the thinker a form of Homeric impartiality. This they contrast with the processual and functional modern understanding of historiography, where events and things are subsumed by a causal linearity. According to Arendt and Benjamin, our past cannot be understood as though in one piece, but should rather be engaged as fragmented and crystallised into events—or pearls—which can be retrieved and can help us to illuminate our past and to understand our present. This paper considers what such an approach would entail for pedagogical theory and practice, as well as for the work of the pedagogical thinker and the teacher.","2019","2026-02-02 18:47:43","2026-02-02 18:47:43","","180-199","","1","53","","","","","","","","Wiley","HOBOKEN","eng","2018 The Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.","","","","","","","","","","Hannah Arendt; Education; Teaching; Education & Educational Research; Educational Practices; History Of Social Sciences; Pedagogy; Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Educational Philosophy; Educational Theories; Educational theory; Figurative Language; Historiography; Pearl Diving; Philosophy of education; Teaching Methods; Walter Benjamin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I am exploring her political theory in The Human Condition which, with the anthropologic category of natality, seems to offer an interesting approach for democratic education. Apparently everyone can participate in politics or even start a revolution. In Arendt's writings on education, however, tradition, conservatism and authority are required as educational key values. Wondering if Arendt's political theory can nevertheless be helpful for democratic education, I turn to The Life of the Mind. Judging might help us to prevent - through education - the reoccurrence of what happened in Germany during the Shoa. I come to the conclusion that in the end Arendt's thought is not contradictory but coherent if we consider her distinctions between the private, the social and the public as well as between the present, past and future.","2012","2026-02-02 18:47:43","2026-02-02 18:47:43","","237-249","","3","7","","","","","","","","Taylor & Francis Group","Abingdon","eng","Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2012","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; natality; Ethics; Hannah Arendt; Education; Foreign Countries; Pedagogy; Authoritarianism; Conservatism; Democracy; Germany; judging; Political Attitudes; Political participation; Political philosophy; Political theory; Politics; Politics of Education; Shoa; The Human Condition; The Life of the Mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It attempts to explore not only the persistence of 'collective guilt' in students' responses, but also new possibilities that are opened when 'collective guilt' is reframed as 'shared responsibility'. The analysis addresses the moral, political and pedagogical implications of viewing the phenomena of collective guilt and shared responsibility through the lenses of Hannah Arendt and Iris Marion Young. The paper suggests that, using Arendt's and Young's accounts of shared responsibility offers educators and students opportunities to become aware of their responsibilities as members of particular social groups, rather than getting stuck in guilt. The proposed pedagogy of shared responsibility is not focused on blame, guilt or fault, but rather it has the potential to minimize denials of complicity and instead encourage students to interrogate the conditions under which they are responsive and responsible to others.","2019","2026-02-02 18:47:43","2026-02-02 18:47:43","","403-417","","3","27","","","","","","","","Routledge","Abingdon","eng","2018 Pedagogy, Culture & Society 2018","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; Hannah Arendt; Pedagogy; Teaching Methods; Anxiety; Classroom Environment; Collective guilt; Educational Methods; Emotions; injustice; Iris Marion Young; Psychological Patterns; Shared Resources and Services; shared responsibility; Social justice; Student Responsibility; suffering; Teacher Responsibility; Young Iris Marion (1949-2006)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper draws on concepts from two renowned political theorists, Carole Pateman and Hannah Arendt, and especially from Arendt's theory of human action, which offers insights for a performative and pluralistic theory of civic engagement, multi-stakeholder learning and collaboration. It helps to explore emerging forms of participatory action and climate change pedagogy in the mountain resort of Canmore (Canada), facilitated by the Biosphere Institute, a local nongovernmental organization, that indicate a strong potential. The Mountain Air program involves schoolchildren and businesses in tackling clean air and idling impacts from local transport (including taxis used by visitors). The results of a door-to-door community social marketing campaign, Sustainable Action Canmore, are also discussed. Detailed and ongoing requirements of participatory action are described, and the results of the two programs are analyzed. Links between governance for tourists and residents are explained, and potential lessons for destination managers discussed. In addition, the paper notes the relevance of the Natural Step program, a comprehensive model for planning sustainable development in complex systems.","2011","2026-02-02 18:47:43","2026-02-02 18:47:43","","571-588","","4-5","19","","","","","","","","Taylor & Francis Group","ABINGDON","eng","Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2011","","","","","","","","","","Hannah Arendt; Pedagogy; Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Arendt Hannah 1906-75; Biosphere; Business; Canada; Citizen participation; Climate change; climate change pedagogy; community participation; Global warming; Government and politics; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Hospitality Leisure Sport & Tourism; local destination governance; Mountains; NGOs; Nongovernmental organizations; performativity; Planning; Science & Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social marketing; Studies; Sustainable development; theory of human action; Tourism; Tourists; 可持续旅游; 教育; 气候变化; 社会变化; 社区参与; 非政府组织","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that Arendt's social question refers to social climbing and not simply poverty, as she initially suggests. The social-climbing framework illuminates ""Little Rock"" in two ways. First, it explains why Arendt opposed mandatory school desegregation, which she saw as black social climbing, that is, African American citizens and the NAACP using the US courts and federal government to raise the status of African Americans to the level of whites. Second, and more significant, it provides a framework for criticizing ""Little Rock"" with Arendt's own standards and criteria in mind. Reminded by Arendt of the suspect politics of social climbing, we can see something she did not: segregation was not ""natural"" association but an institution established after the Civil War to protect white social climbing and social advancement.","2013","2026-02-02 18:47:43","2026-02-02 18:47:43","","533-561","","4","41","","","","","","","","Sage Publications","Los Angeles, CA","eng","Copyright © 2013 Sage Publications","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; Philosophy; Pedagogy; Social Sciences; Political philosophy; Political theory; African Americans; Children; Citizens; Civil Rights Organizations; Civil war; Climbing; Colors; Courts; Criteria; Criticism; Desegregation; Education policy; Essays; Federal Government; Government & Law; Philosophy of history.

(147) In the final part of the book, Sosnowska, upon the basis of preceding reflections, explores the consequences the situation, where classical tradition cannot deliver any solutions, may convey for what totalitarian cataclysms had bequeathed to posterity as the pedagogical task of philosophy. [...]as if (almost) by necessity of the debated problematic itself, the author is compelled to quest, with-and beyond-Arendt, for (ostensibly un-likely) allies among her predecessors and her successors alike, who-in one way or another-surpass (through) the confinement of the ""Heideggerian"" con-text(s): on the one hand, Johann Gottfried Herder's remarks on finiteness and historicity, on linguality and intersubjectivity, as well as, on the other hand, genealogies of (bio)political power by Michel Foucault and of state of exception by Giorgio Agamben (continue to) offer fundamental contributions to the function of philosophical critique for the preservation of essential plurality determining the human condition. The extraordinary achievement of the book Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger that deserves attentive readers both among the scholars of the two authors as well as among pedagogues interested in the philosophical dimension of educational efforts exhorts, by re-awakening the promise of thinking, of its potentiality, of its potency, to the ""vigilance""-but by no means to a ""vigilantism""-of thoughtfulness in a thoughtless, dark time. Since the destiny of a review lies in submitting a mere-more or (rather) less suitable-sketch of the book's thematic abundance, maybe the re-sounding words of a poet, of Robert Frost's poem ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"" nonetheless can, with regard to Sosnowska's work, propose-how many times heard? how many times hearkened to?-a fitting end, a beginning: ""The woods are lovely, dark and deep, / But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep, / And miles to go before I sleep.""","2020","2026-02-02 18:47:43","2026-02-02 18:47:43","","329-333","","112/113","29","","","","","","","","Zalozbe Nova Revija","Ljubljana","eng","Copyright Zalozbe Nova Revija Jun 2020","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; Philosophy; Education; Pedagogy; Modernity; Politics; 20th century; Exegesis & hermeneutics; Foucault Michel; Heidegger Martin (1889-1976); Ontology; Poetry; Traditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such impulses are, in part, the result of a failure to consider childhood as a particular, liminal, space rather than a refraction of the public spaces of the agora. The drive to see education as a vehicle and schools as the site of political change is not confined to the ideological obsessions of Right or Left; both may be considered culpable. Here I illustrate the normative problem through the particulars of a number of socio‐political challenges faced by ‘the World’, and in each case show why it is inappropriate to treat the school and education as the solution. Rather than teaching children how to solve the challenges of the agora, I suggest that what we in actuality do, is teach them the art and artifice of deferral and procrastination because we have failed to assume responsibility for the world. Drawing on Arendt's insights on natality, I suggest that schools should be spaces of ‘qualified’ shelter and that students should not be exposed to the harshness of political choice, nor should teachers merely act as a surrogate for political interests irrespective of their provenance or driving imperative.","2020","2026-02-02 18:47:44","2026-02-02 18:47:44","","23-42","","1","54","","","","","","","","Oxford Univ Press","OXFORD","eng","2019 The Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; Curricula; Education & Educational Research; History Of Social Sciences; Pedagogy; Role of Education; Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Educational Philosophy; Politics; Politics of Education; Children; Ideology; Responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, developing Arendt's claim that education is about the existing generation introducing newcomers to the world, we argue that the object‐side of educational love is not the student, but first and foremost the thing that is studied in the classroom. Educational love is love for the world, not for a person. It expresses itself in the act of affirming that a particular thing is interesting: a part of the world that is worth the effort of being studied together with the new generation. Second, we follow Badiou's account of love as the labour of fidelity to the event, in order to render teaching in terms of staying faithful to one's falling in love with a particular subject matter. Teaching is therefore a continuous attempt at making this event of falling in love present in the classroom. Thus, love for the thing materialises itself in an effort to make the thing endure and to show to the next generation that it is worth of care and attention. Finally, indicating the erotic and agapeic dimension of educational love we turn to Scheler and his position on love and hate as two distinct ways of relating with the world, which respectively come down to an opening and a narrowing‐down mode of world‐disclosure.","2019","2026-02-02 18:47:44","2026-02-02 18:47:44","","518-530","","3","53","","","","","","","","Oxford Univ Press","OXFORD","eng","2019 The Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain.","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; Education & Educational Research; History Of Social Sciences; Pedagogy; Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Educational Philosophy; Teaching Methods; Ontology; Badiou Alain; Disclosure; Intellectual Disciplines; Intimacy; Learning Motivation; Scheler Max","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a discussion of the intersection of public sphere and public space, it engages with the work of Hannah Arendt in order to outline a conception of the public sphere as a space for civic action based on distance and the conservation of a degree strangeness rather than on commonality and common identity. The discussion of the educational work that can be done to support the public quality of common spaces and places focuses on three interpretations of the idea of public pedagogy: that of public pedagogy as a pedagogy for the public, that of public pedagogy as a pedagogy of the public and that of public pedagogy as the enactment of a concern for the public quality of human togetherness. The latter form of public pedagogy neither teaches nor erases the political by bringing it under a regime of learning, but rather opens up the possibility for forms of human togetherness through which freedom can appear, that is forms of human togetherness which contribute to the 'becoming public' of spaces and places.","2012","2026-02-02 18:47:44","2026-02-02 18:47:44","","683-697","","7","13","","","","","","","","Taylor & Francis Group","ABINGDON","eng","Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2012","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; Citizenship; Education; Pedagogy; Social Sciences; Arendt; citoyenneté; ciudadanía; Conservation; domaine public; educación; éducation; esfera pública; Freedom; Geography; identidad; identité; Identity; pedagogía pública; pédagogie publique; public pedagogy; Public Space; Public spaces; Public Sphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Education was not immune from this. In many countries, to limit the spread of the infection, students were required by the government to study remotely. This social isolation in a limited space generated concerns among educators about the quality of learning, notably through virtual platforms. However, this crisis also brought with it an opportunity for change for the better. Social distancing could allow for a 'reflective space' that extended students' learning beyond the physical space. This research paper explores how the disruption of the normality of our lives and the provision of reflective space might enrich religious education, both in terms of curriculum and pedagogy. I will analyse this issue philosophically in light of Hannah Arendt's concept of 'thinking'. This thinking refers to the quest for meaning which occurs when we withdraw ourselves from inter homines esse (being among humans) into a solitary realm. Drawing on Arendt's ideas, I argue that the reflective space enables us to reimagine religious education such that it better prepares students from across the cultural and religious spectrum for a democratic society.","2024","2026-02-02 18:47:44","2026-02-02 18:47:44","","236-244","","3","46","","","","","","","","Routledge","ABINGDON","eng","2023 The Author(s).

"BC4H847Q","book","2016","Bakker, Cok.; Montessori, Nicolina Montesano.","Complexity in Education : From Horror to Passion","","978-94-6300-764-1","","","","""This volume, the result of four years of work performed by the combined research groups of Utrecht University (Faculty of Humanities) and the HU Utrecht University of Applied Sciences (Faculty of Education), focuses on the central theme of ‘Normative Professionalization’. Drawing on a wide variety of scholars including Hannah Arendt, Gert Biesta, Harry Kunneman, Donald Schön and Chris Argyris, and engaging with professionalism, ethics, virtue and morality, this book builds the argument that learning to deal with complexity supports not only education but the personal development of teachers and the improvement of society and democracy as well. This volume presents research on a broad range of topics such as worldview education, co-teaching, moral authorship, traditional-reform perspectives on education, the discourse on citizenship, teacher education, and the question how to link religion and education. The research chapters explain the theoretical lensesand methodological approaches which have been employed to get a grip on complexity. The results have been interpreted in light of the concepts of horror complexitatis, amor complexitatis and dolor complexitatis. Guided by detailed research accounts of worldview descriptions provided by students and teachers, this framework has been enriched with the notion of a passio complexitatis. In the concluding chapters, the book advocates for an improved balance between the normative and instrumental professionalization of teachers, in order to create space for the improvement of pedagogical relations and processes and to reintroduce the moral dimensions of education. The claim throughout this book is that allowing for complexity in education – even going so far as to embrace it – is vital for the improvement of education, and a prerequisite for more authentic relationships (on the micro level) and the maintenance of a well-functioning democracy and a balanced society (on the macro level). This book is of interest to researchers and educators who are interested in normative professionalization, to qualitative and practice oriented researchers, to teachers and managers in primary, secondary and professional education, and to the wider public which is concerned with the significance of education for the development of a stable and sustainable society."".","2016","2026-02-02 18:47:44","2026-02-02 18:47:44","","","","","","","","","Education Series","","","","SensePublishers","Rotterdam","eng","","","","","","","Publication Title: Complexity in Education : From Horror to Passion","","","","Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st ed. 2016.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considered were approaches that science teachers can use in science classes in secondary schools. They were analyzed and discussed against the backdrop of critical pedagogy by Paulo Freire and the educational theory by Hannah Arendt, which constitutes a novelty in science education research. The review used meta interpretation combined with systematic searches in the ERIC database. It is, thus, limited to works published in English. A total of 930 articles (2013–2021) were identified out of which 64 were fully analyzed. The analysis shows that most approaches strive to provide more equal access to the existing science knowledge and structures of the community. This corresponds to the introduction to the “old world” in a conservative interpretation of Arendt's term. I argue that in addition, it is necessary to employ a more radical interpretation of the “old world” as fundamentally plural which is done in translanguaging and grappling with racism. Further, the transformative nature of science education needs to be strengthened in terms of Freire's critical pedagogy and Arendt's concept of natality. This means allowing students to become aware of oppressive structures to induce change. Only youth participatory science, youth participatory action research, and grappling with racism explicitly aim for this. This shows that nuanced perspectives on equity in science education are needed.","2024","2026-02-02 18:47:44","2026-02-02 18:47:44","","1191-1221","","4","108","","","","","","","","Wiley","HOBOKEN","eng","2024 The Authors.

Connections are then made between Arendt's account of this rise and Jean Baudrillard's account of the postmodern proliferation of signs and the transformation of the sign into a commodity. This radical ""semiurgy"" accelerates into a self-referential series of signs which entails the loss of reality–it contributes to the disappearance of the human subjectivity behind the creation of images. I argue that Baudrillard does not respond adequately to the dynamic that he describes so well. By contrast, Arendt's concept of natality, I suggest, prepares the ground for a response to the forces of commodification that colonize the educational environment and threaten its critical possibilities. As youth and schools receive more and more attention from advertisers, students are sold by educational institutions to commercial interests who seek unfettered access to this ""captive audience"". Yet education is profoundly compromised when youths are viewed as consumers and not as a social investment, when education is viewed merely as an opportunity to secure a new market.","2006","2026-02-02 18:47:45","2026-02-02 18:47:45","","457-477","","6","25","","","","","","","","Springer","Dordrecht","eng","Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2006","","","","","","","","","","Arendt Hannah; Philosophy; Education; Teaching; Pedagogy; Role of Education; Public sphere; Advertising; Baudrillard Jean; Commodification; Consumer Economics; Consumerism; Consumers; Consumption; Disappearance; Dominance; Educational Environment; Life Style; Postmodernism; Public life; Public schools; Purchasing; Quality of Life; Semiotics; Social Capital; Subjectivity; Theory of education; Transformation; World Views","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
